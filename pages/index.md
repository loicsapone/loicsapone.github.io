Hello everyone! I'm **Lo√Øc Sapone**, a web developer based in Grenoble for over 10 years. My expertise primarily 
focuses on **backend development and DevOps**, where I strive to design tailor-made applications and websites that meet 
the specific needs of my clients.  

I had the opportunity to kickstart my journey at [Mezcalito](https://www.mezcalito.fr/){.link target=_blank}, the 
digital agency in Grenoble, where I discovered the world of SCOPs and eventually became an associate. During this 
time, I contributed to diverse projects, ranging from institutional websites like 
[FC Grenoble Rugby](http://fcgrugby.com/){.link} to specialized e-commerce platforms such as the 
[Sport 2000 ski rental website](https://location-ski.sport2000.fr/){.link target=_blank}.    

In addition to my professional engagements, I also had the chance to teach the intricacies of **PrestaShop** to 
students at [MMI Grenoble](https://real-mmi-grenoble.fr/){.link target=_blank} during four enriching years.  

I'm also proud to have obtained the 
[Symfony certification](https://connect.symfony.com/profile/loic_sapone){.link target=_blank}, a 
testament to my ongoing commitment to staying at the forefront of technology in my field. Furthermore, you'll notice 
that I'm a staunch advocate of open source, a philosophy that shines through the projects you can explore below.
